Gravity Forms Quantity Limits
=============================

Version 0.8

Limit the display of product fields with Gravity Forms based on the number of entries.

Currently only works for single product fields with a quantity defined. Limit does not count against entries in the trash.

Great for event registration or product quantity limiting.
